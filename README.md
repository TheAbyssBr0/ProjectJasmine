# ProjectJasmine
A journaling and TODO application for your CLI. I wrote this to track my projects, my projects, and how much time I'm spending on them.

Written entirely in python with a ready restful API if the application needs to be accessed from another device.

## Todos
- [ ] Implement tab autocomplete for typed commands
- [ ] Implement arrow key navigation (and suitable UI changes to accomodate)
- [ ] Implement mouse support
- [ ] Precompiled binaries for MacOS (ARM), Windows (ARM and x86_64), Linux (ARM)

## Known bugs:
* Command response moves backwards with backspace

How to run:
---
o You can run the python file main.py

o You can run the precompiled binary on linux x86_64 machines
  > it was generated using pyinstaller

The RESTful API requires Flask :)
